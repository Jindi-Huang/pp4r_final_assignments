    <h1>An exploration of the Zurich property market</h1>
    
    Two hundred detailed applications, three spotless reference letters, and absolutely no musical instruments - some say that finding an apartment in Zurich is harder than finding your dream job. 
    After experiencing the struggle of trying to find a suitable apartment in Zurich, we decided to explore the features of the Zurich rental property market. 
    We wanted to answer questions like is this 2.5 room apartment in Wiedikon for 4,000.-/month a total rip-off? 
    Or is this new build 1 room apartment in Oerlikon for 800.-/month a total steal?
    So read on for a deep dive into what has been described as the most expensive and most competitive property market in the world.

    <br>

    We began by scraping the Homegate website for properties for rent in Zurich. We found 980 properties on the 50 most recent search results pages. We dropped 
    properties with a rental price over 20,000.-/month as these appeared to be outliers. We then plotted a histogram to see the distribution of rent prices.
