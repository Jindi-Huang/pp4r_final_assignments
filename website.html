    <title>An exploration of the Zurich property market</title>

    <h1>An exploration of the Zurich property market</h1>
    
    <p> 
        Two hundred detailed applications, three spotless reference letters, and absolutely no musical instruments - some say that finding an apartment in Zurich is harder than finding your dream job. 
        After experiencing the struggle of trying to find a suitable apartment in Zurich, we decided to explore the features of the Zurich rental property market. 
        We wanted to answer questions like is this 2.5 room apartment in Wiedikon for 4,000.-/month a total rip-off? 
        Or is this new build 1 room apartment in Oerlikon for 800.-/month a total steal?
        So read on for a deep dive into what has been described as the most expensive and most competitive property market in the world. 
    </p>
    
    <h3>Key statistics about the Zurich property market</h3>

    <p>
        We began by scraping the Homegate website for properties for rent in Zurich. We found 980 properties on the 50 most recent search results pages. We dropped 
        properties with a rental price over 20,000.-/month as these appeared to be outliers. We then plotted a histogram to see the distribution of rent prices.
    </p>

    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="output/figures/histogram_gross_rent.png" width = "700" >
     </div>
    
     <p>
        As you can see there is a wide distribution of rental prices in the market, and somewhat surprisingly, rent per sqm is even more dispersed. 
        Now let's take a look at how average rent varies between the different municipalities of Zurich:
    </p>

    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="output/figures/histogram_gross_rent_by_city.png" width = "400" >
     </div>
    
     <p>
        It seems like average rent varies a lot by municipality. Glattbrugg and Oberengstringen would be good areas to search if your budget is limited, while if
         you have a small fortune to blow on rent, look at areas along the lake such as Kilchberg and Zollikon. I wonder if the delicious smell of chocolate from
         the Lindt factory in Kilchberg is what is driving the prices up... It's time to look at the distribution of some other property characteristics such as living
         area, year built, number of rooms and floor level (unfortunately, we don't have data on proximity to chocolate factories yet).
    </p>

    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="output/figures/histogram_4_characteristics.png" width = "800" >
     </div>

     <p>
        So what does this tell us? Most properties for rent are under 200 sq. m. but there a few sprawling mansions around. The vast majority of properties have been 
        built since 1900 but there are a few "period" properties up for grabs. In addition, the most common number of rooms is 3.5. Furthermore, properties are 
        typically on floors 1 to 5 but you can also find an apartment on the 22nd floor (hope there's a lift!) or on the -2nd floor for those who prefer to live in 
        darkness (it could also be a garage space).
    </p>

    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="output/figures/scatter_rent_living_area.png" width = "500" >
     </div>
    
    <p>
        Looking at the relationship between living space and rent, we see that these are closely correlated.
    </p>

    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="output/figures/scatter_characteristics_year.png" width = "800" >
     </div>

     <p>
        The relationship between other property characteristics and rent is less clear-cut. A correlation matrix might tell us more...
    </p>

    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="output/figures/heat_map.png" width = "600" >
     </div>
     
     <p>
        The correlation matrix shows that, as we have seen in the scatterplot, rent and living area are strongly positively correlated. Number of rooms is also highly
        positively correlated with rent. Year built is negatively correlated with rent. Can we then say that new builds are more expensive? Well, maybe. It also appears
        that year built is negatively correlated with number of rooms. It might therefore be that new builds are only more expensive because they typically have fewer
        rooms. So, if you were looking for a 2 room apartment and wanted to know whether an old or new building would be cheaper, we cannot yet say. We now perform
        linear regression to establish what really determines the rental price of property in Zurich.

    <p>
        Column (1) shows that when we do a simple regression of rent on living area, there is a positive relationship. This is in line with what we expect. 
        In column (2) we include number of rooms as a covariate. The results are interesting - when we control for number of rooms, the coefficient on living 
        area increases. In addition, the coefficient on number of rooms is negative and significant. This suggests that on average a 2 room 40 sq. m. 
        apartment is cheaper than a 1 room 40 sq.m. apartment. In column (3) we include floor level as an additional covariate. The coefficient on floor level is 
        positive and significant at the 5% level. This suggests that people value being higher up in a building. The coefficient on number of rooms is no 
        longer significant, suggesting that the negative relationship between number of rooms and rent once living area is controlled for is due to properties on 
        higher floors tending to have fewer rooms and renters valuing properties on higher floors more. Column (4) includes year built: we see a negative and 
        significant coefficient on year built. This suggests that renters value older properties more than newer ones. Note that the coefficient on living 
        area increases when we include additional covariates. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Column (5) includes municipality fixed effects. The coefficient on year built is no longer significant, suggesting that older properties may only be more 
        expensive because they are located in more desirable neighbourhoods. The coefficient on living area is significant at the 1% level. No other covariate 
        is significant at any level. This regression tells us that an extra sq. m. in Zurich adds around 39.- to the monthly rent for a property. The R&#178; suggests 
        that living area, number of rooms, floor level, year built and municipality account for around two thirds of the variation in property prices, with the 
        remaining third unexplained by these characteristics.
